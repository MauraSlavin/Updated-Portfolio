# Responsive-Portfolio

Modified the Basic Portfolio to make it look nice on all screen sizes with a Responsive screen, without using Bootstrap.

Home page contains a picture of me and a few paragraphs about me.  Shows wrapping around text.

Portfolio page has clickable links to completed projects with enticing (hopefully!) thumbnails.  Shows wrapping and formatting skills.

Contact page is a fillable form to send me a message.  Not yet working, but it looks nice!  Shows skill in presenting an attractive form.

Page includes navigation from any page to any other page.


Home page is 'mauraslavin.github.io/Updated-Portfolio'.
