# Portfolio
https://mauraslavin.github.io/Updated-Portfolio/

Modified the Updated Portfolio to add more recent projects (and like to Github page, too), links to LinkedIn, Github and resume, add more personal information & personalize color scheme.

Home page contains a picture of me and a few paragraphs and personal information about me.  There are links to my LinkedIn, Github pages and my resume.

Portfolio page has clickable links to completed projects with enticing thumbnails.  Shows wrapping and formatting skills.

Contact page is a fillable form to send me a message.  Not yet working, but it looks nice!  Shows skill in presenting an attractive form.

Page includes navigation from any page to any other page.
