      <p >Hello! I’m Maura Slavin, and I’m excited to get back into coding!</p>

      <p>I worked for IBM as a programmer in the past and took a break to raise my family. I have always enjoyed working
        on the computer. Much of our household tasks are digitalized, from family finances to household chores. I’m
        eagerly anticipating work that stimulates me intellectually.
        Since leaving IBM, I have done many diverse things. Starting slow, with leading Girl Scout troops and teaching
        religious ed classes. Then stepping up to overseeing regional Girl Scout financial accounts and part time jobs.
        Most recently, I’ve led the formation of a new 501c3 non-profit, Marina’s Miles (see MarinasMiles.org) which has
        awarded $12,000 in scholarships over the past three years, and has almost twice that invested for future
        scholarships.</p>

        <p>Here are some fun facts about me:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I once jumped out of an airplane.</li>
          <li>I hiked Mt. Jefferson by myself. I didn't make it to the top, but hope to one day. It was BEAUTIFUL!!</li>
          <li>I'm teaching myself Spanish on Duolingo.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>I enjoy spending time with my family, bicycling, reading, hiking and just being outside (in almost any kind of
        weather – as long as I’m dressed properly &#x263A).</p>

      <p>Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope we have the pleasure of meeting soon!</p>
